<h1>Program</h1>

<p>  <a href='https://mossi-conf.github.io/MOSSI-22/program.html' style="font-size:18px;" ><b>AVAILABLE HERE</b></a>.  </p>

<h1>Online Presence</h1>
<p>There will be tweets from <a href='https://twitter.com/MossiConf'><b>@MossiConf</b></a> throughout the conference. I'd encourage everyone to use #MOSSI22 in any posts.</p>

<p> I also wanted to provide a social space for online people, so I've created a <a href='https://discord.gg/yc8DDkpVfZ'><b>MOSSI22 discord</b></a>. You can join without creating an account - you do not have to register and you just have to demonstrate that you are sufficiently old with the provided birthday (you don't have to give away your personal info). While you cannot log back into a temporary account, you can join the channel again.</p>

<p> If you're posting anywhere else, let people know and we can boost it!</p>

<h1>Location</h1>
Conference Location - note that the entrance is easier from the small side street <br>

<h1>Surrounding Area</h1>
<p> The University of Adelaide forms part of the cultural centre of Adelaide north of Rundle Mall. To the west of the University there is the State Library, Museums and the South Australian Art Gallery, to the east there is the Botanic gardens and, to the north is the Karrawirraparri (River Torrens). I would recommend all if you have a spare moment (since they are just next door). </p>

<p>For food close by there is the hub on campus, as well as Hindley Street (location of conference dinner), Rundle Mall and Rundle Street. A bit further afield there is also North Adelaide. </p>

<p> We look forward to seeing you and hope you enjoy your time in Adelaide. </p>
